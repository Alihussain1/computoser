Computoser
==========

An algorithm for music composition. Results can be seen at http://computoser.com

The code of the algorithm is in the main package (com.music), the rest of the packages contain the model and the classes required for the website computoser.com

The paper describing the algorithm in details is available <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9696759/Computoser_-_rule-based_probability-driven_algorithmic_music_composition">here</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.307">here</a>
